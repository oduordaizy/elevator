# Elevator Simulation
This repository contains a simulation of an elevator machine that distributes people to various floors in a building. The elevator waits for users (students or staff) to press the floor button they wish to go to. The machine simulates the behavior of an elevator with three doors (A, B, and C) that alight at different floors.
